These matlab files are intended to compare the speech codec results of the
C implementation with those of the MATLAB implementation.
 
In for these files to work, the folder containing the MATLAB implementation
must either be correctly set by the 'matlab_path' parameter in the 
checkAnalysis, checkSynthesis, checkFullCodec, and genRefSig functions,
or added to the MATLAB path manually (using the addpath command, for
example). If not, said functions will throw an error.


OVERVIEW OF M-FILES
-------------------

-   checkAnalysis: checks if the analysis result of the C implemenation are
    equal to that of the MATLAB implementation. First run the checkAnalysis
    bash script before executing this function. The MATLAB referenence
    results are computed directly from the input.wav file in the C folder
    (except when a subBandsRef input is supplied; see documentation).

-   checkSynthesis: checks if the synthesis results of the C implementation
    are equal to those of the MATLAB implemenation. First run the
    checkAnalysis script before running this function. The MATLAB reference
    is computed directly from the input.wav file in the C folder (except
    when a synthSigRef input is supplied; see documentation).

-   checkFullCodec: checks if the complete codec operation (i.e. analysis,
    compression, dequantization, and synthesis) produces equal results for
    the C and MATLAB implemtations. First run the SBC bash script before
    running this function. The MATLAB reference is computed directly from
    input.wav file in the C folder. To speed up the process, an outputRef
    input can be supplied (see documentation).

-   runAllChecks: performs checkAnalysis, checkSynthesis, and 
    checkFullCodec for all signals in the WAVdb folder (assumed to be
    in the parent folder of debugfiles). To speed up theprocess,
    runAllChecks uses the precomputed MATLAB results stored in refSig.mat.
    runAllChecks executes the C code itself, hence there is no need to run
    the C beforehand.

-   genRefSig: generates the refSig.mat file, which contains the output
    results of the MATLAB implementation for all signals in the WAVdb
    folder.


OVERVIEW OF MAT FILES
---------------------

-   refSig.mat: result of genRefSig for the signals in WAVdb generated by
    the createDownsampledWavDB function with the scale parameter set to
    false. That is, the signals are simply downsampled from 16 to 8 kHz, 
    but the signal values remain the same as in the original version.
    Because the MATLAB implemenation by default uses rescaled signals (see
    below), the obtained PESQ values will differ from the ones mentioned
    in the MATLAB report.

-   refSig_scaled.mat: result genRefSig for the signals in WAVdb generated
    by the createDownSampledWavDB function with the scale parameter set 
    to true. That is, the signals are not only downsampled but also
    rescaled to occupy the full range of a 16-bits integer, in the same way
    as was performed by the loadWavDB function from the MATLAB
    implementation with its scale input set to true. This way, the same
    PESQ and SNR values as mentioned in the MATLAB report are obtained.

-   codecResults: contains the results of runAllChecks
